Fraternity website

This is a basic framework for a fraternity website. It includes the following features:

-   A basic file structure with `templates`, `assets`, and `scripts` directories.
-   A responsive menu, although the HTML and CSS files have not yet been added.
-   Sections for events, member login, and community messages will be added later.
-   The events section will display a list of upcoming events.
-   Each event will have a title, description, date, and any other relevant details.
-   The member login area will allow members to securely log in.
-   A form for new members to register will also be added.
-   The community message area will display messages to the community.
-   These messages will be easily updated.

Future steps:

-   Add HTML templates for the menu, events, login, and community sections.
-   Add CSS styling to make the site visually appealing.
-   Add JavaScript for any dynamic interactions.
-   Add content to each section.
- Add all the static files to the correct folders.
- Add any necessary scripts to the correct folders.
- Test the full website.
