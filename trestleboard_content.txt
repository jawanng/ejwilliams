 E. Jerry Williams The Man 
The Early Years 
E. Jerry Williams was born in Pocomoke City, Maryland to Laura J. Williams and the Reverend Elijah J. Williams, a Baptist minister. His early  education began in the public schools of Worcester County, Maryland. Soon after the death of his father, the family moved to Baltimore, where  E. Jerry Williams was enrolled in the Baltimore County public school system. His early education also included piano lessons that eventually  enabled him to become an accomplished musician. During those early years, E. Jerry joined People's Church and later served as Superintendent  of the Sunday school Department. He graduated from Douglas High School and went on to pursue higher education at Morgan State College  (now Morgan State University) where he earned the Bachelor of Arts degree in 1930.  
The Middle Years 
A new chapter began in the life of E. Jerry Williams when he returned to the Eastern Shore. He moved to the town of Berlin, Maryland to become  Principal of Flower Street High School. This was the beginning of a mutual admiration between E. Jerry and the residents of Berlin that would  last for two decades. He was very active in the community and served with the Masons, the Odd Fellows, the NAACP, and various educational  organizations. He continued his education earning a Master of Science degree from the University of Pennsylvania. He also began to spread his  musical talents on piano, organ and choral techniques throughout the community and on occasion, he even chimed in with his own rich and  melodious bass voice. E. Jerry was very interested in the education and development of young people. The fact that he himself came from a poor  family, enabled him to understand the plight of youngsters who could not attend school because of a lack of clothing or other necessities.  Therefore, he intervened to provide assistance whenever possible. E. Jerry Williams, who worked his way through school, realized the value and  importance of an education. Consequently, he shrived to educate and prepare his students for the future while at the same time introducing them  to the arts of music, poetry, and drama. His stay in Berlin came to an end in the early 1950's when he moved to Princess Anne, Maryland to  become Principal of Greenwood High School. In Princess Anne, he became active in the leadership of the Somerset County Educational  Association. He fought a continuing battle for better educational facilities for teachers and students. The final stop in his educational career was  Lexington Park, Maryland where he became principal of George Washington Carver High School. It was a time when the integration of schools  was just beginning to take place in St. Mary's County. E. Jerry's involvement with the Saint Mary's County Educational Association and a special  task force assisted in providing a smooth integration process and the development of mutual understandings between teachers and students of  different races. 
The Later Years 
After a long and illustrious career during which he inspired many teachers and pupils, E. Jerry Williams retired from the school system in July  1969. After a brief period, he returned to Baltimore, the city of his childhood. Through the many years, he maintained his activities with the  Masons, Shriners, and other fraternal organizations in the state of Maryland. He also returned to the church of his childhood, which had now  become Memorial Baptist church. The final chapter in the life of E. Jerry Williams began when he decided to enter the ministry. It is believed that  he had always dreamed of following in his father's footsteps. That dream came true when, after various preparations, he was ordained into the  Baptist Ministry in the early 1970's. Even at this late stage in his life, he continued his pursuit for higher education, and earned the Doctor of  Divinity Degree from Baltimore College of Bible. He eventually became Assistant Pastor at Memorial Baptist Church. He remained in that  position until his death on August 24, 1979. E. Jerry Williams had one daughter, Barbara, and three sons, E. Jerry Williams, Jr., Willis, and Billy.

Romans 5:8 “But God commended his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us”. 
I humbly accept the great honor that you have bestowed by electing me Worshipful Master for Masonic Year 2024-2025. First giving the Glory and  Honor to the Great Architect of the Universe. Second allow me to thank the brothers of E. Jerry Williams Lodge. No. 141 for their support and  considering me as a candidate for this amazing office.

Each of you are members of our team and we need your support. With the help of each of you we can grow in  numbers, knowledge and brotherly love. “Remember Let’s Fight for Those Who Can’t Fight for Themselves!!! 
I also wish to thank my children Christian and Hadiya Oliver for their continued support, motivation and allowing me the privilege of being a father and  especially allowing me the opportunity to watch as you both battled disabilities and NEVER allowed your different learning styles to encompass who and  what you are for that courage I learned to be a dad I love you both. 
I ask each of us to continue to use the GREATEST light in masonry to always guide us in our beloved lodge as well as in our daily lives!!! 
Understanding that each of us are assigned a life duty without knowledge of any completion dates or forecast but ultimately knowing that only God’s  planning of our lives is pre-arranged by our heavenly father’s virtues may this blank promissory note be rendered as paid in full
